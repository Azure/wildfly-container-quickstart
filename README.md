# WildFly on Containers QuickStart

This repository contains artifacts to help you get started running WildFly 
applications on Azure container platforms, such as the Azure Kubernetes Service 
(AKS).

### Pre-requisites

For running locally:

* [Docker CLI](https://docs.docker.com/install/)

For running on Azure:

* [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/install-azure-cli)
* [An Azure subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).

### Building and testing locally

If you have Docker CLI installed locally, you can run this quick start on your 
machine:

1. Clone the repository and navigate into the root of the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Azure/wildfly-container-quickstart.git
    cd wildfly-container-quickstart
    ```

1. Build the WAR file locally.

```shell
mvn package
```

1. Build the docker image:

    ```bash
    docker build -t wildfly -f src/main/docker/Dockerfile .
    ```

1. Run the image:

    ```bash
    docker run -p 8080:8080 -d wildfly
    ```

    Once the container is running, navigate to `http://localhost:8080` in 
    [your favorite browser](https://www.microsoft.com/edge). You should see the 
    web application come up.

### Building and testing on Azure

Alternatively, you can build and test the image entirely on Azure. These steps 
can be performed from [Azure CloudShell](https://shell.azure.com) or from any 
machine with [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/install-azure-cli)
installed.

1. [Create an Azure Container Registry](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.ContainerRegistry).
   Be sure to enable the admin user.

1. Clone the repository and navigate into the root of the repository:

```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Azure/wildfly-container-quickstart.git
    cd wildfly-container-quickstart
```

1. Build the WAR file locally.

```shell
mvn package
```

1. Once the Azure Container Registry instance is created, run the following 
   command, where `${REGISTRY_NAME}` is the name of the Azure Container Registry
   you just created:

    ```bash
    az acr build -r ${REGISTRY_NAME} -t "${REGISTRY_NAME}.azurecr.io/wildfly" -f src/main/docker/Dockerfile .
    ```

    The Azure Container Registry will now build the docker image on its own
    server.

1. Once the image build has completed, run the following command. It will deploy
   the image onto an Azure Container Instance. `${RESOURCE_GROUP}` should be the
   name of a resource group in your azure subscription. `${REGISTRY_NAME}` should
   be the same as above:

    ```bash
    az container create -g ${RESOURCE_GROUP} -n ${REGISTRY_NAME} \
      --image "${REGISTRY_NAME}.azurecr.io/wildfly"  \
      --registry-password "$(az acr credential show -n $REGISTRY_NAME --query "passwords[0].value" -o tsv)" \
      --registry-username "${REGISTRY_NAME}" \
      --ip-address Public \
      --ports 8080 \
      --query "ipAddress.ip"
    ```

    When the command completes, it will display an IP address. 
    Navigate to `http://<The IP Address>:8080` in your browser, and you should 
    see the home page of the deployed web application.

    To terminate the container instance, run

    ```bash
    az container delete -g ${RESOURCE_GROUP} -n ${REGISTRY_NAME} --yes
    ```
